// What is OOP?
/*
ANSWER :- object-oriented programming
        Object-oriented programming (OOP) is a computer programming model that organizes
        software design around data, or objects, rather than functions and logic. An object can be
        defined as a data field that has unique attributes and behavior. 

        OOP focuses on the objects that developers want to manipulate rather than the logic
        required to manipulate them. This approach to programming is well-suited for programs that
        are large, complex and actively updated or maintained. This includes programs for
        manufacturing and design, as well as mobile applications; for example, OOP can be used for
        manufacturing system simulation software.
